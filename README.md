## Learning Activities & Resources
I dedicated time this past week to further increase my knowledge and skills in using the project management tools and resources that would be required for successful teamwork towards the group goals 

I led the setup of essential group resources for our project, emphasizing Trello for task management, Slack for communication, and GitHub for version control. I delved into the integration process, connecting Slack to GitHub to streamline communication, keep members updated on any project updates and task updates, I also integrated Trello into Slack that would allow for better project management as we can create and move tasks in different cards through it. Trello to manage tasks, GitHub to store code, and Slack as a communication channel. I integrated the tools so Slack sends notifications on GitHub commits and creates Trello tasks. This allows transparency into everyone's work while keeping conversations and tasks organized. One thing I did notice is that every team member would have to subscribe to Github and Trello so that they can view these updates. Collaboratively, our team focused on project planning, ensuring a thorough breakdown of tasks and responsibilities. We explored the functionalities of each platform to optimize their use for effective collaboration. Every team member collectively gave their insights and shared their knowledge on the different subjects of discussion. This helped us understand dependencies and workflow.

# Content Insights
## The hands-on practical tasks provided well-rounded insights on:

The process of forming teams based on interview responses provided valuable insights into creating well-rounded groups with diverse skills and perspectives. This approach ensures comprehensive project coverage and promotes a collaborative environment. Setting up project management tools is crucial for group work. Trello enables task breakdown, assignment, and progress tracking. GitHub facilitates code collaboration and version control. Slack provides a shared communication history. Integrating them provides awareness of project activity across tools. Effective task decomposition is also key - we broke down the project into granular, assignable pieces of work across our skillsets. This level of planning and coordination doesn't happen organically and requires dedicated up-front effort.

## Important Insight
Regarding project management tools, our team opted for Trello over GitHub Projects due to its user-friendly interface and flexibility in task management. Trello's visual boards, cards, and lists allow for an intuitive and customizable workflow, making it an ideal choice for our diverse team. Additionally, past experiences of team members with Trello contributed to its selection, as familiarity and positive outcomes from previous projects underscored its effectiveness in enhancing productivity and coordination within our group setting.

Our group also opted for Visual Studio Code (VS Code) over Sublime Text and Atom as the preferred code editor for customizing the WordPress website due to its versatility, efficiency, and collaborative features.
VS Code stands out among other code editors for several reasons: <br>
1) Integrated Version Control <br>
2) Live Share for Collaboration <br>
3) Continuous Updates and Community Support <br>
4) Past experiences with the use of VSCode <br>

While other code editors like Sublime Text and Atom have their merits, VS Code's combination of versatility, community support, and collaborative features makes it a strong choice for our WordPress customization project. Its adaptability to various languages, seamless integration with Git, and live collaboration capabilities align well with the dynamic and collaborative nature of web development projects.
